How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?  
Treat this as a learning environment for everyone involved. The stakes are low here, no one should feel left out or out of place. Pair Programming to help areas team members are deficient in.

Settle one on one, if not able to settle bring in mediation. Be realistic about your skills, and what you can accomplish without or with help.

Assuming an agreement is not able to be made. It will be up to the other group members to come to a decision on what to do.
