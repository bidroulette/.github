### Conflict Plan  

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Settle with one on one if possible, if not mediation with a neutral party.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Settle one on one, and ensure that not only is everyone able to contribute, but that we are going out of our way for contribution from everyone. Open Communication is important.  
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?  
Treat this as a learning environment for everyone involved. The stakes are low here, no one should feel left out or out of place. Pair Programming to help areas team members are deficient in.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?  
Settle one on one, if not able to settle bring in mediation. Be realistic about your skills, and what you can accomplish without or with help.
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
Assuming an agreement is not able to be made. It will be up to the other group members to come to a decision on what to do.  

### Communication Plan  

What hours will you be available to communicate?
Whole team 9-6PM, unless otherwise specified.(Very likely)
What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?  
Slack will be the main method of communication, phones will be a last means.
How often will you take breaks?  
12-1 lunch time. Every hour for 15 minutes.
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?  
Team meeting to decide on what the most appropriate course of action is. Mob coding to complete main features. Trello board will contain timelines.  
How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?  
Slack for after hours, and on the weekend.  

### Work Plan  

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?  
Beginning of the day meeting for division of work, and where to work once their division of work is complete. Ask for help, don't stay stuck.
What project management tool will be used?  
Trello and Whiteboard software as a last resort.  

### Git process  

What components of your project will live on GitHub?  
Back-End and possibly a simple front-end.
How will you share the repository with your teammates?

What is your Git flow?  
Have our own individual branch which is then committed to a deployed devbranch. Once it passes on the devbranch it can be uploaded to main branch.
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?  
Everyone needs to give updates on their specific portion of the code each morning. Check in at mid-day to check up on everyone.  
How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?  
Everyone provides constructive feedback, with areas to improve in an area of no judgement.
